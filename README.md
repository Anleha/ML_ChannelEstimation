## 📝 Overview

This project implements machine learning-based channel estimation techniques (DNN, CNN, LSTM) for MIMO-OFDM systems in the context of 5G and beyond wireless communication.

---

## 📁 File Descriptions

- `trainingdata_gen.m`  
  Generates training and testing datasets simulating MIMO-OFDM channel conditions.

- `DNN_training.m`, `CNN_training.m`, `LSTM_training.m`  
  Train deep learning models (DNN, CNN, LSTM) for channel estimation.

- `OFDM_ChannelEstimation_Inference.m`  
  Runs the trained models to perform channel estimation on test data.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- MATLAB R2021a or later
- Deep Learning Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox

### How to Use

1. **Generate Dataset**
   ```matlab
   trainingdata_gen
   ```

2. **Train a Model**
   Choose one model to train:
   ```matlab
   DNN_training    % For Deep Neural Network
   CNN_training    % For Convolutional Neural Network
   LSTM_training   % For Long Short-Term Memory Network
   ```

3. **Run Inference**
   ```matlab
   OFDM_ChannelEstimation_Inference
   ```
